# Calendar Scripts

Scripts for working with Calendar.

## Contents

- [WFO to Calendar](./WFO%20to%20Calendar.applescript)
    - This is a relatively complex script that was exported as an Applet used within my job to export a work schedule from the WFO website and import the result into a personal calendar so the schedule could be available on personal devices without having to login to check it.
    - This is not really intended for general use, but as an example of how to work with Calendar using ASObjC (AppleScript Objective-C).
